# Walkthrough: ECO PWA Foundation

I have successfully initialized the ECO PWA project with a premium mobile-first design, all requested routes, and Supabase integration.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Foundation & Design
- **Modern UI**: Implemented a "glassmorphism" based design system with vibrant colors (`#10b981` primary) and smooth transitions.
- **Mobile-First Layout**: Created a standard container limited to 480px width for a native app feel on all devices.
- **Bottom Navigation**: Persistent navigation with icons from `lucide-react`.
- **PWA Support**: Added [manifest.json](file:///c:/Projetos/COOP%20ECO/public/manifest.json) for "Add to Home Screen" capability.

### 2. Routes & Logic
- **Placeholder Ecosystem**: Created 14+ specific routes with consistent layouts and "Back" navigation.
- **Supabase Client**: Configured client using `@supabase/ssr` to support both client and server components.
- **CTA Driven**: Home page features a prominent "Pedir Coleta" (Recycle) CTA.

### 3. Documentation
- [BRIEFING.md](file:///c:/Projetos/COOP%20ECO/BRIEFING.md): Product vision and roadmap.
- [DECISIONS.md](file:///c:/Projetos/COOP%20ECO/DECISIONS.md): Technical and product rules (e.g., "Like" doesn't exist, Recibo ECO requirement).
- [.env.example](file:///c:/Projetos/COOP%20ECO/.env.example): Template for configuration.

## Verification Results

### Build & Lint
- **Lint**: `npm run lint` passed successfully.
- **Build**: `npm run build` completed with all static pages generated.

```bash
✓ Generating static pages using 11 workers (14/14)
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

## Responsive Preview (Mockup)
- **Home**: Hero section with impactful headline + CTA.
- **Mural**: Feed placeholder for social actions.
- **Mapa**: Placeholder for location-based services.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement actual authentication flow using Supabase Auth.
- [ ] Design the "Pedir Coleta" multi-step form.
- [ ] Model the database schema in Supabase.
